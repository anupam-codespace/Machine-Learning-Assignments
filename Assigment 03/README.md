Decision Tree Classifier on Iris Dataset
Overview:
This project demonstrates the implementation and visualization of a Decision Tree Classifier using the classic Iris dataset in Python with scikit-learn.
Dataset:
150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width
3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica
Objective: Classify iris flowers based on their features
Features:
Train/Test split
Decision Tree classifier using entropy impurity
Model training and prediction
Accuracy evaluation
Visualization of the tree structure
