K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) on Iris Dataset
Overview:
KNN is a simple supervised learning algorithm for classification. This project classifies iris flowers based on 4 features: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
Dataset:
150 samples, 3 classes: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, Iris-virginica
Features:
Train/Test split
Configurable KNN classifier
Model training & prediction
Accuracy evaluation
Visualization of decision boundaries
Result:
Effective classification of iris species with visual insights.
